def apply_rotary_pos_emb(q, k, cos, sin, position_ids, unsqueeze_dim=1):
    """Applies Rotary Position Embedding to the query and key tensors.
 
    Args:
        q (`torch.Tensor`): The query tensor.
        k (`torch.Tensor`): The key tensor.
        cos (`torch.Tensor`): The cosine part of the rotary embedding.
        sin (`torch.Tensor`): The sine part of the rotary embedding.
        position_ids (`torch.Tensor`):
            The position indices of the tokens corresponding to the query and key tensors. For example, this can be
            used to pass offsetted position ids when working with a KV-cache.
        unsqueeze_dim (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The 'unsqueeze_dim' argument specifies the dimension along which to unsqueeze cos[position_ids] and
            sin[position_ids] so that they can be properly broadcasted to the dimensions of q and k. For example, note
            that cos[position_ids] and sin[position_ids] have the shape [batch_size, seq_len, head_dim]. Then, if q and
            k have the shape [batch_size, heads, seq_len, head_dim], then setting unsqueeze_dim=1 makes
            cos[position_ids] and sin[position_ids] broadcastable to the shapes of q and k. Similarly, if q and k have
            the shape [batch_size, seq_len, heads, head_dim], then set unsqueeze_dim=2.
    Returns:
        `tuple(torch.Tensor)` comprising of the query and key tensors rotated using the Rotary Position Embedding.
